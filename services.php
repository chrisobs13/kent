        <p>At the start of the process JMKent Building Inc. works with the client to create a budget that fits the design of what the client wants or needs.  Once design and budget are set, construction begins.  This allows for a smooth construction project, avoiding costly changes and delays.  We use this process consistently from the smallest remodel to a large custom home. We offer 3D computer-generated designs for your remodeling projects, so you can see what your new space will look like before a single tool is taken out.</p>
