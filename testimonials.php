                <p>Jared,<br/> I would like to thank you and your team for a professional remodeling job at our summer home in Gray Gables this past spring of 2010.</p>
                <p>

 Gail and I had been discussing the possibilities of how to create more space on the second floor and integrate it with an updated bathroom. Your design ideas worked perfectly to create a seamless transition from an old original 1933 bathroom to an updated bathroom. Also, your design allowed us to expand the space in our back bedroom and add more natural light. Constructing it within the parameters of the original house also allowed us to keep the charm of the original layout.</p>
 <p>

  All of this was very important to make us a very satisfied customer; but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that first the project was always neat, second, it came in on budget, third it was on time. Thank you for taking care of us; and feel free to use us as a referral.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br/>
Brian J. Kennedy
